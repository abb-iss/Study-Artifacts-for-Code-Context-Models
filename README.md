# Study Artifacts: Supporting Search and Navigation through Code Context Models

Thomas Fritz, Christoph BrÃ¤unlich, and David Shepherd conducted a study of twelve developers performing one of three change tasks using the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. Below we publish the data collected during this study.  Our data consists primarily of twelve transcripts of developer actions transcribed by hand from the approximately two hours of video collected from each participant. Further details on the study setup can be found in our paper (preprint coming soon).
